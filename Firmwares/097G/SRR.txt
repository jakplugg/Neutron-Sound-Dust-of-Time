SRR "Shape reactive resonator"

Imagine you have a weight on a long bouncy spring and you are holding the top of the spring in your hand.

when you move your hand around in different ways, the weight can move in a nice regular rythm, or quite chaotically.

now imagine your hand is tracing the shape of a waveform, the output is tracing the path of weight. 

the weight will not follow a nice safe trajectory as a normal analog or digital filter would. it will change depending on what came before. sometimes a particular pitch or timbre will make it go distorted in peculiar ways. it can be "on edge" so the smallest change in a setting brings out a whole new sound. 

now imagine that in glorious 1 Dimentional data, 

That is what the SRR "Shape reactive resonator" does. 

you can adjust the bounciness of the spring (damping) also like filter "resonance"

Scaling the strength of the "spring force" adjusts how fast the output level moves toward the input. this is like a filter frequency.

strength of zero, input, output, 

there could be a wavetable for force vs velocity, etc it should have some effect on the output waveform (how?)

I expect this would be quite an awful filter for audio reproduction!

this thing only needs 3 saved values, and a few add and mult operations per sample.
